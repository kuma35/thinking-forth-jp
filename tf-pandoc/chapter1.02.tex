\person{Parnas}\index{P!Parnas, David} proposes two criteria for
decomposition:

%% special case: uses second level without outer level
\begin{tfquot}
%%!!!this is to avoid an error
%% \makeatletter\@newlistfalse\makeatother
%%!!!
\ifeightyfour\begin{list}{\alph{enumi}.}{\usecounter{enumi}}
\else\begin{enumerate}\fi
\item possible (though currently unplanned) reuse, and
\item possible (though unplanned) change.
\ifeightyfour\end{list}
\else\end{enumerate}\fi
\end{tfquot}
This new view of a ``module'' is different than the traditional
view. This ``module'' is a collection of routines, usually very
small, which together hide information about some aspect of the problem. 

Two other writers describe the same idea in a different way, using the
term ``data abstraction'' \cite{liskov75}%
\index{D!Data abstraction}.
Their example is a push-down stack. The stack ``module'' consists of
routines to initialize the stack, push a value onto the stack, pop a
value from the stack, and determine whether the stack is empty. This
``multiprocedure module''%
\index{M!Multiprocedure module}
hides the information of how the stack is constructed from the rest of
the application. The procedures are considered to be a single module
because they are interdependent. You can't change the method for
pushing a value without also changing the method for popping a value.

The word \emph{uses} plays an important role in this concept.
\person{Parnas}%
\index{P!Parnas, David|(}
writes in a later paper \cite{parnas79}:

\begin{tfquot}
Systems that have achieved a certain ``elegance''\dots{} have done so
by having parts of the system use other parts\dots{}

If such a hierarchical ordering exists then each level offers a
testable and usable subset of the system\dots{}

The design of the ``uses'' hierarchy should be one of the major
milestones in a design effort. The division of the system into
independently callable subprograms has to go in parallel with the
decisions about \emph{uses}, because they influence each other.
\end{tfquot}\index{P!Parnas, David|)}
A design in which modules are grouped according to control flow or
sequence will not readily allow design changes. Structure, in the
sense or control-flow hierarchy, is superficial.

A design in which modules are grouped according to things that may
change can readily accommodate change.%
