\section{Summary}

In this chapter we've seen two ways that applications can be
decomposed: into components, and according to sequential complexity.

Special attention should be paid to those components that serve as
interfaces between other components.

Now, if you've done preliminary design correctly, your problem is
lying at your feet in a heap of manageable pieces. Each piece represents a
problem to solve. Grab your favorite piece and turn to the next chapter.%
