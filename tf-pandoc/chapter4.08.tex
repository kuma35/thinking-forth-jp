\section{Summary}

In this chapter we've learned to develop a single component, starting
first with deciding on its syntax, then proceeding with determining its
algorithm(s)\index{A!Algorithms}
and data structure(s), and concluding with an implementation in \Forth{}.

With this chapter we complete our discussion of design. The remainder
of the book will discuss style and programming techniques.
