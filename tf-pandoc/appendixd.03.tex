\item This will work:
\begin{Code}
20 CHOOSE  2 CHOOSE  IF NEGATE THEN
\end{Code}
But this is simpler:
\begin{Code}
40 CHOOSE  20 -
\end{Code}
\end{enumerate}\else
\begin{Code}
: DIRECTION  ( n|-n|0 -- 1|-1|0)  DUP  IF  0< 1 OR  THEN ;

%% Note: The question was random number between 0 and 19, and -20 and 0.
%% The first solution gives between 0 and 19, or -19 and 0.
%% The second solution doesn't give a double likelyhood for 0.
%% It's a bit tricky to get both question and answer really correctly.
