After defining the interfaces, and sometimes defining the rules,
occasionally you'll need to define certain data structures as well.
We're not referring here to the implementation of the data structures,
but rather to a description of their conceptual model.

If you're automating a library index, for instance, a crucial portion
of your analysis will concern developing the logical data structure.
You'll have to decide what information will be kept for each book:
title, author, subject, etc. These ``attributes'' will comprise an
``entity'' (set of related records) called \forth{BOOKS}. Then you'll
have to determine what other data structures will be required to let
the users search the \forth{BOOKS} efficiently.

%You may need another entity consisting of authors' names in
%alphabetical order, along with ``attribute pointers'' to the books
%each author has written.

Certain constraints will also affect the conceptual model of the data
structure. In the library index example, you need to know not only
\emph{what} information the users need, but also how long they're
willing to \emph{wait} to get it.

For instance, users can request listings of topics by year of
publication---say everything on ladies' lingerie between 1900 and
1910.  If they expect to get this information in the snap of a girdle,
you'll have to index on years and on topics. If they can wait a day,
you might just let the computer search through all the books in the
library.%
