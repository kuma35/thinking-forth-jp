\ifeightyfour\begin{enumerate}
\item
You have the word \forth{CHOOSE} which takes an argument ``$n$''
and returns a random number between 0 and $n-1$. The result is always
positive or zero.  You can use \forth{CHOOSE} to produce a flag; the
phrase
\begin{Code}
2 CHOOSE
\end{Code}
produces a random flag of zero or one (false or true).

%%!!! this is not the second question, there is no question above
\item
Write a phrase to choose a number at random between 0 and 19 (inclusive)
\emph{or} between $-20$ and 0.
\end{enumerate}\else
%% replacement problem
Define the word \forth{DIRECTION}, which returns either 1,
$-1$, or 0, depending on whether the input argument is non-zero
positive, negative, or zero, respectively.
