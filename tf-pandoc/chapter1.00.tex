\chapter{The~Philosophy of~\Forth{}}\Chapmark{1}

\expandafter\initial\Forth{} is a language and an operating
system. But that's not all: It's also the embodiment of a
philosophy. The philosophy is not generally described as something
apart from \Forth{}. It did not precede \Forth{}, nor is it described
anywhere apart from discussions of \Forth{}, nor does it even have a
name other than ``\Forth{}.''

What is this philosophy? How can you apply it to solve your software
problems?

Before we can answer these questions, let's take 100 steps backwards
and examine some of the major philosophies advanced by computer
scientists over the years. After tracing the trajectory of these
advances, we'll compare---and contrast---\Forth{} with these
state-of-the-art programming principles.
