\section{Summary}
In this chapter we've examined the tradeoffs between using the stack and
using variables and other data structures. Using the stack is preferable
for testing and reusability, but too many values manipulated on the stack
by a single definition hurts readability and writeability.

We also explored techniques for saving and restoring data structures,
and concluded with a study of vectored execution using
\forth{DOER}/\forth{MAKE}.%
