Interview with a Software Inventor
==================================

, owner and president of Scientek Instrumentation, Inc.:

I have a few techniques I’ve found useful over the years in designing
anything, to keep myself flexible. My first rule is, “Nothing is
impossible.” My second rule is, “Don’t forget, the object is to make a
buck.”

First examine the problem, laying out two or three approaches on paper.
Then try the most appealing one, to see if it works. Carry it through.
Then deliberately go all the way back to the beginning, and start over.

Starting over has two values. First, it gives you a fresh approach. You
either gravitate back to the way you started, or the way you started
gravitates toward the new way.

Second, the new approach may show all kinds of powerful possibilities.
Now you have a benchmark. You can look at both approaches and compare
the advantages of both. You’re in a better position to judge.

Getting stuck comes from trying too hard to follow a single approach.
Remember to say, “I want this kumquat crusher to be different. Let’s
reject the traditional design as not interesting. Let’s try some crazy
ideas.”

The best thing is to start drawing pictures. I draw little men. That
keeps it from looking like “data” and interfering with my thinking
process. The human mind works exceptionally well with analogies. Putting
things in context keeps you from getting stuck within the confines of
any language, even Forth.

When I want to focus my concentration, I draw on little pieces of paper.
When I want to think in broad strokes, to capture the overall flow, I
draw on great big pieces of paper. These are some of the crazy tricks I
use to keep from getting stagnant.

When I program in Forth, I spend a day just dreaming, kicking around
ideas. Usually before I start typing, I sketch it out in general terms.
No code, just talk. Notes to myself.

Then I start with the last line of code first. I describe what I would
like to do, as close to English as I can. Then I use the editor to slide
this definition towards the bottom of the screen, and begin coding the
internal words. Then I realize that’s a lousy way to do it. Maybe I
split my top word into two and transfer one of them to an earlier block
so I can use it earlier. I run the hardware if I have it; otherwise I
simulate it.

Forth requires self-discipline. You have to stop diddling with the
keyboard. Forth is so willing to do what I tell it to, I’ll tell it to
do all kinds of ridiculous things that have nothing to do with where I’m
trying to go. At those times I have to get away from the keyboard.

Forth lets you play. That’s fine, chances are you’ll get some ideas. As
long as you keep yourself from playing as a habit. Your head is a whole
lot better than the computer for inventing things.
