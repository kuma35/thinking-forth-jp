Summary
=======

In this chapter we’ve learned to develop a single component, starting
first with deciding on its syntax, then proceeding with determining its
algorithm(s) and data structure(s), and concluding with an
implementation in Forth.

With this chapter we complete our discussion of design. The remainder of
the book will discuss style and programming techniques.
