Summary
=======

Maintainability requires readability. In this chapter we’ve enumerated
various ways to make a source listing more readable. We’ve assumed a
policy of making our code as self-documenting as possible. Techniques
include listing organization, spacing and indenting, commenting, name
choices, and special words that enhance clarity.

We’ve mentioned only briefly auxiliary documentation, which includes all
documentation apart from the listing itself. We won’t discuss auxiliary
documentation further in this volume, but it remains an integral part of
the software development process.
