The Nine Phases of the Programming Cycle
========================================

As we’ve seen, Forth integrates aspects of design with aspects of
implementation and maintenance. As a result, the notion of a “typical
development cycle” makes as much sense as a “typical noise.”

But any approach is better than no approach, and indeed, some approaches
have worked out better than others. Here is a development cycle that
represents an “average” of the most successful approaches used in
software projects:

Analysis
    #. Discover the Requirements and Constraints

    #. Build a Conceptual Model of the Solution

    #. Estimate Cost/Schedule/Performance

Engineering
    4. Preliminary Design

    5. Detailed Design

    6. Implementation

Usage
    7. Optimization

    8. Validation and Debugging

    9. Maintenance

In this book we’ll treat the first six stages of the cycle, focusing on
analysis, design, and implementation.

In a Forth project the phases occur on several levels. Looking at a
project from the widest perspective, each of these steps could take a
month or more. One step follows the next, like seasons.

But Forth programmers also apply these same phases toward defining each
word. The cycle then repeats on the order of minutes.

Developing an application with this rapid repetition of the programming
cycle is known as using the “Iterative Approach.”
