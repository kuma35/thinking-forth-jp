Implementation: Elements of Forth Style
=======================================

Badly written Forth has been accused of looking like “code that went
through a trash compactor.” It’s true, Forth affords more freedom in the
way we write applications. But that freedom also gives us a chance to
write exquisitely readable and easily maintainable code, provided we
consciously employ the elements of good Forth style.

In this chapter we’ll delve into Forth coding convention including:

-  listing organization

-  screen layout, spacing and indentation

-  commenting

-  choosing names

I wish I could recommend a list of hard-and-fast conventions for
everyone. Unfortunately, such a list may be inappropriate in many
situations. This chapter merges many widely-adopted conventions with
personal preferences, commented with alternate ideas and the reasons for
the preferences. In other words:

: TIP VALUE JUDGEMENT ;

I’d especially like to thank , who proposed many of the conventions
described in this chapter, for his continuing efforts at unifying
divergent views on good Forth style.
