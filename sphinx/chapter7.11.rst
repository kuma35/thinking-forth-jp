Summary
=======

In this chapter we’ve examined the tradeoffs between using the stack and
using variables and other data structures. Using the stack is preferable

stack by a single definition hurts readability and writeability.

We also explored techniques for saving and restoring data structures,
and concluded with a study of vectored execution using /.
