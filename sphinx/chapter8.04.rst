Summary
=======

The use of logic and conditionals as a significant structural element in
programming leads to overly-complicated, difficult-to-maintain, and
inefficient code. In this chapter we’ve discussed several ways to
minimize, optimize or eliminate unnecessary conditional structures.

As a final note, Forth’s downplaying of conditionals is not shared by
most contemporary languages. In fact, the Japanese are basing their
fifth-generation computer project on a language called PROLOG—for
PROgramming in LOGic—in which one programs entirely in logic. It will be
interesting to see the battle-lines forming as we ponder the question:

To or not to

In this book we’ve covered the first six steps of the software
development cycle, exploring both the philosophical questions of
designing software and practical considerations of implementing robust,
efficient, readable software.

We have not discussed optimization, validation, debugging, documenting,
project management, Forth development tools, assembler definitions, uses
and abuses of recursion, developing multiprogrammed applications, or
target compilation.

But that’s another story.
