Detailed Design/0Problem Solving
================================

| *Trivial:* I can see how to do this. I just don’t know how long it
  will take.
| *Non-trivial:* I haven’t a *clue* how to do this!

Once you’ve decided upon the components in your application, your next
step is to design those components. In this chapter we’ll apply
problem-solving techniques to the detailed design of a Forth
application. This is the time for pure invention, the part that many of
us find the most fun. There’s a special satisfaction in going to the mat
with a non-trivial problem and coming out the victor.

In English it’s difficult to separate an idea from the words used to
express the idea. In writing a Forth application it’s difficult to
separate the detailed design phase from implementation, because we tend
to design in Forth. For this reason, we’ll get a bit ahead of ourselves
in this chapter by not only presenting a problem but also designing a
solution to it, right on through to the coded implementation.
