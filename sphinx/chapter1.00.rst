The Philosophy of Forth
=======================

Forth is a language and an operating system. But that’s not all: It’s
also the embodiment of a philosophy. The philosophy is not generally
described as something apart from Forth. It did not precede Forth, nor
is it described anywhere apart from discussions of Forth, nor does it
even have a name other than “Forth.”

What is this philosophy? How can you apply it to solve your software
problems?

Before we can answer these questions, let’s take 100 steps backwards and
examine some of the major philosophies advanced by computer scientists
over the years. After tracing the trajectory of these advances, we’ll
compare—and contrast—Forth with these state-of-the-art programming
principles.
