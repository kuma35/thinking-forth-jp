Spacing and Indentation Guidelines
==================================

1 space between the colon and the name

2 spaces between the name and the comment [1]_

2 spaces, or a carriage return, after the comment and before the
definition

3 spaces between the name and definition if no comment is used

3 spaces indentation on each subsequent line (or multiples of 3 for
nested indentation)

1 space between words/numbers within a phrase

2 or 3 spaces between phrases

1 space between the last word and the semicolon

1 space between semicolon and (if invoked)

No blank lines between definitions, except to separate distinct groups
of definitions

.. [1]
   An often-seen alternative calls for 1 space between the name and
   comment and 3 between the comment and the definition. A more liberal
   technique uses 3 spaces before and after the comment. Whatever you
   choose, be consistent.
