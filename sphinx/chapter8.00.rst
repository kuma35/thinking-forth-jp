Minimizing Control Structures
=============================

Control structures aren’t as important in Forth as they are in other
languages. Forth programmers tend to write very complex applications in
terms of short words, without much emphasis on constructs.

There are several techniques for minimizing control structures. They
include:

-  computing or calculating

-  hiding conditionals through re-factoring

-  using structured exits

-  vectoring

-  redesigning.

In this chapter we’ll examine these techniques for simplifying and
eliminating control structures from your code.
